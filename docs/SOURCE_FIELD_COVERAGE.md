# Source field coverage

Stage 9 source-completeness pass, 2026-09-26. This document records which review facts
each approved source family publicly exposes, where GatherRadar reads them, and a
field-by-field audit of every Event in the final fresh acceptance workbook.

Acceptance principle: if an approved public source clearly exposes a fact and the
supported data contract includes it, the fact must survive into SQLite and every
portable output. Every empty field must be explained as one of:

| Code | Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M | `matched` | Source-supported, stored and displayed |
| S | `source_missing` | The source does not expose the fact for this item |
| A | `ambiguous` | Exposed but deliberately unresolved (recurrence, broad relative date) |
| U | `intentionally_unsupported` | Outside the current contract (taxonomy, structured data) |
| R | `access_restricted` | Only behind login, checkout or a robots-disallowed path |
| BUG | `BUG` | Source-supported and lost — must be zero |

## Field semantics

| Workbook column | Machine field | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `مکان` | `venue_name` | A named physical venue |
| `منطقه / محله` | `area_text` | Approximate neighborhood/district, never a precise address |
| `شهر` | `city` | City, only when the text names one |
| `آدرس` | `address` | Detailed street/postal address |
| `زمان‌بندی اعلام‌شده` | `source_schedule_text` (else `source_date_text`) | Exact source schedule wording |
| `مدت` | `duration_text` | Explicitly stated length |
| `ظرفیت / وضعیت ثبت‌نام` | `availability_text` | Explicit availability wording |
| `توضیحات / معرفی` | `description_text` | The source's own description, never a generated summary |
| `برگزارکننده` | `organizer_name` | Explicitly labelled organizer/host |

## Per-adapter source-fact inventory

Where each fact is read. "Card" is the item's own listing anchor; "structural" means an
adapter-verified value from explicit page structure (see [data contracts](DATA_CONTRACTS.md)).

| Adapter | Listing card | Detail header | Detail body / sections | Structured labels | Explicit links |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vadoostan/2` | category chip (kept as evidence), title, `محله:` area (structural), `ساعت:` time, one badge = price **or** availability (structural) | title heading; date/time · area · duration slots (structural) | `توضیحات` description (structural); FAQ excluded | organizer card caption `برگزار کننده` (structural name; biography excluded) | booking is `/app/auth/login` only |
| `jabama-events/2` (Events and Experiences) | title, `city · venue`, leading length in the meta slot (structural), price row (structural), rating/“new” labels (kept, not interpreted) | h1; clock tile (date, schedule, or leading length — length structural); map-pin tile (venue) | `درباره این …` description (structural); `قوانین و نکته‌ها`, `ساعت و تاریخ رویداد` text; booking-aside price (structural) | `محل برگزاری` venue section; `میزبان` host section (structural name, profile link excluded) | purchase is a script button; `/checkout`, `/tickets` robots-disallowed |
| `davvvat/1` | generic anchor text | retained panel | detail panel text | standalone `برگزارکننده` heading (organizer), `آدرس` label | registration hrefs in text |
| Instagram | — | — | caption only (media OCR optional, not used in this bounded run) | text labels only (`محله:`, `مدت:`, `برگزارکننده:`, `ظرفیت:`) | “link in bio”; no URL |

The Jabama detail page also embeds booking-session datetimes in its script payload
(observed on all four inspected Jabama details) that are not visible text. Metadata-only
structured data and occurrence expansion are outside the current contract, so these are
classified `U`, and are a clear candidate for a future stage.

## Coverage matrix by source family

✓ = publicly exposed and supported (card = L, detail = D); ✗ = not exposed; U = outside
contract; R = restricted; — = not evaluated. Observed on live pages on 2026-09-26 unless noted.

¹ From the five locally stored captions per source (collected 2026-09-20); not re-collected
live in this pass. Tehran by Tehran has no local or current data, so it is not evaluated.
Instagram captions have no structural description boundary: the caption remains the raw
evidence and is not copied into `description_text` (U).

**Davvvat Website is blocked by policy.** Its robots.txt now contains an explicit
`User-Agent: GatherRadar` / `Disallow: /` group. The transport refuses every request,
the source fails in isolation (`robots:robots`), and no bypass is attempted. Earlier stored
Davvvat website observations and the sanitized Davvvat fixture remain; the Davvvat
venue/address/organizer pattern is covered offline. The owner should decide whether to
disable `davvvat_website`; until then each run reports it as a failed source.

## Jabama Experiences

| Item | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery | Site navigation tab `تجربه‌ها` on the Tehran listing (not guessed) |
| Listing URL | `https://jabama.events/all?city=tehran&type=experiences` |
| Detail pattern | `/events/<digits>`, `/events/legacy-<digits>`, `/events/event-<digits>` |
| Rendering | Static server-rendered HTML; the existing public HTTP transport works; no browser |
| Access | robots.txt allows `/all` and `/events/`; disallows `/checkout/`, `/profile`, `/tickets`, `/wallet` |
| Adapter | Existing `jabama-events/2` (same detail layout as Events); declarative source `jabama_experiences_website`, publisher `jabama_events` |
| Collected | 5 details per bounded run (22 cards on the first listing page; no pagination) |
| Semantics | One RawItem per detail; discovery decides Event/Place/Other (2 of 5 were Other in the final run) |
| Overlap | The same detail can appear in the Events listing; `same_source_page` groups it into one Event |
| Field support | Title, venue, city, price (“از …” starting price), description, host, and length (card/detail) or weekly schedule; no visible date for bookable experiences (sessions only in embedded booking data, U) |
| Restrictions | Purchase requires the script booking flow; no public registration URL |

## Final audit — every displayed Event

221 audited cells: 113 matched, 73 source missing, 14 intentionally unsupported, 12
access restricted, 9 ambiguous, **0 BUG**. Source-supported → preserved: **113 / 113**
(every matched fact is stored in SQLite and displayed; outputs agree, see
[validation](STAGE9_VALIDATION.md)).

Notes behind the less obvious cells:

- **Category U on Vadoostan and some Jabama items.** The provisional taxonomy has no
  entry for the source genre (Vadoostan chips `بازی`/`موسیقی`/`ورزش`, Jabama stand-up or
  performance). For Events 1 and 3, the displayed `کارگاه` is inferred from prose (`کلاس`)
  and does not reflect the source chip. This is a known taxonomy limitation (an open
  product decision), not lost source text: the chip stays in the listing evidence.
- **Vadoostan city S.** Event evidence names only a neighborhood; the `تهران` filter
  button on the listing is not event evidence, and an area never implies a city.
- **Jabama date/time U.** Only the page's embedded booking data lists sessions.
- **Event 4 venue M.** The source description labels `📍 مکان: درکه`, so venue and area
  are both `درکه` by source wording.
- **Event 7.** A weekend round-up caption without a concrete occurrence (a discovery false
  positive); its detail would be in media, which this caption-only run did not acquire.
- **Events 12 and 13** show the same description: both public pages carry that identical
  text; each was extracted from its own page.

## Completeness of the final workbook (13 displayed Events)

| Field | Populated | Field | Populated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Title | 12 | Duration | 7 |
| Category | 7 | Price | 11 |
| Primary date | 5 | Availability | 1 (sold out) |
| Time | 5 | Description | 12 |
| Source schedule (machine / displayed) | 7 / 11 | Organizer | 12 |
| Venue | 9 | Registration URL | 0 |
| Area | 4 | Source URL | 13 |
| City | 8 | Address | 0 |

Population is not the success measure: every blank above is classified in the audit.

## Limitations

- Card/detail clock disagreement is not detected separately; temporal wording uses the
  existing ranking, with a structural detail header date taking precedence.
- Release gate (2026-09-27): the Vadoostan board-game night is now an Event through the
  structured-occurrence rule (verified detail date/time slot plus price). The two Jabama
  experiences stay Other: their visible pages state no date or clock time (sessions exist
  only in embedded script data), so they lack concrete occurrence evidence.
- Vadoostan genre chips are kept as `source_category_text`; `category` is set only by a
  supported mapping, so prose such as `کلاس‌های جادو` no longer yields `کارگاه`.
- Jabama booking sessions exist only in embedded script data (see above).
- Co-organizers are not guessed: several organizer cards yield no organizer.
- Area is never geocoded, and no address is derived from it.
