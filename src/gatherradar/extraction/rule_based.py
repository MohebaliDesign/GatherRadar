"""The deterministic, free discovery provider.

This is GatherRadar's default: no model, no API key, no network access, no cost. It
reads the signals found in the source text, scores them with the weights in `rules`,
and decides between an event, a place, and neither — then reports why.

Two ideas keep it honest.

**No single keyword decides anything.** An event needs a recognized path through the
evidence, not one word. Two paths are legitimate, because real captions come in two
shapes:

* **Path A** — event terminology together with date, time, or registration evidence.
  The classic announcement.
* **Path B** — strong event terminology or a validated named event, together with an
  invitation to attend, plus venue or location context when the terminology alone is
  not specific enough. This is the shape of a post that says where to come and when
  they are waiting for you without ever printing a date, and requiring a date was the
  tuning mistake that made the first version of this engine too strict.

An attendance invitation alone never creates an event, and neither does a date alone,
an address alone, or an event word alone.

**Evidence that it already happened counts against it, but never vetoes.** A recap
carries retrospective phrases; a post that is both a recap and an announcement of the
next occurrence can still outweigh them.
